Comment Toxicity Model: A Deep Learning Solution for Content Moderation
Designed and deployed a sophisticated Comment Toxicity Model leveraging advanced Deep Learning techniques to detect and moderate toxic user-generated content effectively:

Deep Learning Implementation: Developed a robust model using TensorFlow and Keras, incorporating state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify text data with high accuracy.

Data Collection & Preparation: Curated a diverse dataset of user comments from multiple sources to ensure comprehensive coverage of various contexts and dialects, enabling effective model training and testing.

Neural Network Design: Architected a neural network with recurrent (LSTM/GRU) and convolutional layers to capture complex linguistic patterns and subtle toxic behavior markers in text.

Optimization & Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned hyperparameters and experimented with model configurations to enhance performance, achieving a balanced trade-off between sensitivity to toxicity and minimizing false positives.

Transfer Learning Integration: Leveraged pre-trained embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe, significantly improving the model's understanding of contextual relationships and language nuances.

Overfitting Mitigation: Applied techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and regularization to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting during training.

Evaluation Metrics: Conducted comprehensive model evaluations using precision, recall, and F1-score to validate its accuracy and reliability in detecting toxic comments.

Real-Time Integration: Collaborated with a team to integrate the model into a web application, enabling real-time comment analysis and content moderation for a seamless user experience.

Documentation & Community Contribution: Documented the project lifecycle, methodologies, and outcomes, sharing insights and source code on GitHub to contribute to the NLP and AI community.

Impact & Proficiency: Demonstrated expertise in Deep Learning and NLP by delivering a scalable, real-world solution for automated toxicity detection, showcasing adaptability to cutting-edge tools and techniques.

This project underscores a strong capability to design and implement advanced AI-driven solutions that address critical challenges in online content moderation, improving platform safety and user experience.
